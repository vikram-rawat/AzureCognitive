Description: An interface to Azure Cognitive Speech Services <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/>. Both an 'Azure Resource Manager' interface, for deploying Cognitive Services resources, and a client framework are supplied. While 'AzureCognitive' can be called by the end-user, it is meant to provide a foundation for other packages that will support specific services, like Computer Vision, Custom Vision, language translation, and so on. Part of the 'AzureR' family of packages.
